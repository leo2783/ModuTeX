// PUSHED from the renderers, not pulled. Pulling would mean a request/response round trip into a
// renderer that may be mid-way through building a ProseMirror document, which blocks its main
// thread for a second or more on a large paper. A tool call that has to wait that out (or time out
// and lie) is worse than one answering from a cache that is a few hundred ms stale.
//
// Main already owns the root -> window mapping via the `windowRoots` registry in main.ts, so roots
// never need a round trip at all. Only the per-window detail below does.
