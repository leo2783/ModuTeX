// Which Typst nodes fold, and where each fold starts and ends.
//
// A syntax tree does not give folding on its own: CodeMirror asks either a `foldService` or the
// `foldNodeProp` hung on node types, and a tree with neither has nothing foldable. BOTH are needed
// here, for a reason worth writing down:
//
//   - Blocks (code, content, argument lists) are single nodes that span from their opening
//     delimiter to their closing one, so the node prop describes them directly.
//   - Headings cannot use the prop at all. Typst's tree is flat — a Heading node covers only the
//     heading LINE, not the content beneath it — and CodeMirror's syntaxFolding skips any node
//     whose `to` is at or before the end of the line being folded. A heading is always exactly
//     that, so its prop callback would never even be consulted. Sections therefore go through a
//     foldService, the same mechanism .tex uses (intellisense/fold.ts).
//
// This lives in the app rather than in packages/typst-syntax-wasm because both APIs come from
// @codemirror/language, and that package deliberately depends on Lezer only.
