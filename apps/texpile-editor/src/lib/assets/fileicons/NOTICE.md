# File-type icons

Vendored from **Material Icon Theme** (`material-icon-theme` on npm, v5.37.0) —
<https://github.com/material-extensions/vscode-material-icon-theme>

Only the icons this app actually shows are copied here, and the sole modification to each is
adding `width`/`height` of `100%` so it fills its slot. **The upstream colours are kept.** They
were briefly retinted to `currentColor` to match the tree's monochrome tone, which failed for a
reason worth recording: apparent lightness follows a glyph's ink coverage, not its colour, so a
single tone made dense marks (markdown) read far heavier than sparse ones (the TeX logotype), and
antialiasing thinned hairlines further at 16px. Hue does the differentiating instead, and the
density mismatch stops mattering.

Their square viewBoxes are load-bearing: they are what makes every icon centre identically in
the tree's icon slot. Don't crop them to their glyph bounds.

`folder.svg` / `folder-open.svg` cover directory rows. The pack also ships ~200 name-matched
folder variants (`folder-images`, `folder-dist`, ...) which are deliberately **not** vendored:
they colour-code a tree by source-repo conventions that don't mean anything in a writing
workspace.

To refresh, re-run `npm pack material-icon-theme`, then copy + retint the files listed in
`fileIconMap.ts`.
